# ShMonsters
Once upon a time the ShMonsters were friendly beings living in the wild. With the emerge of Shiden/Kusama network they became visible to the world. Without the knowledge of the outside world they happily embraced new owners who only paid for theirs travel expanses (lodging and gas). New owners enslaved the ShMonsters and some even sold them to slavery. But the wise ShMonster hatched a plan how to multiply and overrun their masters. There was an ancient legend that on Shiden planet liveth a SheMonster who can bear a monster kids who can one day become ferocious Sholdiers. However if the world becomes a better place those Sholdiers can forever stay happy Shildren. In order to start this quest we first need to free ShMonsters and spread them around the world in search of the Lords of Shiden who will tell them where SHE can be found.
